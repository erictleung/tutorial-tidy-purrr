## Overview

## What is Tidy Data?

[According to Jeff Leek](https://leanpub.com/datastyle), tidy data has the following properties:

1. Each variable should have its own column.
2. Each observation of that variable should be in its own row
3. One table for each "kind" of variable (microarray data, sample table & demographics)
4. Multiple tables should have an identifier column to let you join them together.

## Why Tidy Data?

In short, most R packages expect tidy data in one form or another. 

Specifically: tidy data makes it easy to:

- Manipulate into different forms (reshaping/summarizing)
- Join with other tidy data
- Visualize
- Load into databases, etc.

Much of my time as an analyst is getting my data into a form that I can analyse.

**Core Packages**

- `ggplot2` (graphics)
- `tibble` (data frames and tables)
- `tidyr` (make tidy)
- `readr` (read in tabular formats)
- `purrr` (functional programming)
- `dplyr` (manipulate data)

## How do we get it?

To get all the tidyverse packages, you can install it with a single command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(tidyverse)
```

## Overall Workflow

![Data science exploration general workflow](./images/data-science.png)

We'll follow this workflow with a use case of reading in an Excel document,
cleaning it up, and visualizing it.

```{r Import tidyverse}
library(tidyverse) # Import tidyverse
```


## Read in Data

![Import and wrangle data](./images/data-science-wrangle.png)


## Sample Dataset A

![Dataset A](./images/datasetA.png)


## Sample Dataset B

![Dataset B](./images/datasetB.png)


## Let's Read in the Data

```{r Read in data}
# Using the readxl package to read in Excel files
library(readxl)
rawData <- read_excel(path = "data/all_data.xlsx", # Path to file
                    sheet = 2, # We want the second sheet
                    skip = 1, # Skip the first row
                    na = "NA") # Missing characters are "NA"
```


## Take a Look at the Data

```{r}
head(rawData) # Tibble shows small bit of the data
```


## Another Way to Look at Data

```{r}
rawData
```

## The Tidyverse is all about verbs and pipes

Let's look at a typical tidyverse operation. 

```{r}
cleanData <- rawData %>% 
  filter(gender == "male") %>% 
  mutate(diffWeight = startWeight - endWeight, 
         weightChangePerDay = diffWeight / timeElapsed)

#show data
```

We'll take this apart bit by bit.

## Pipes let you go from start to finish.

The first thing to notice is the `%>%` character. This is called a "pipe" character. 

It lets you take the output of one function and make it the input of another function.

When you chain multiple functions together, you are building a pipeline.

## Some basic verbs for manipulating data

The nice thing about the tidyverse is that most of the functions are defined as verbs that you do to data.

- `filter()` - remove rows according to a criteria
- `select()` - select columns by name
- `mutate()` - calculate new column variables by manipulating data
- `arrange()` - sort data by columns

## dplyr::filter()

`filter()` lets you select rows according to a criteria. You can use `|` (OR) and `&` (AND) to chain together logical statements.

```{r message=FALSE}
filteredData <- rawData %>% 
  filter(gender == "male")

head(filteredData)
```

How would we also filter the dataset for patients who had `startWeights` greater than 150?

Note that any statement or function that produces a boolean vector (such as `is.na(Species)`) can be used here.

## dplyr::select()

`select()` lets you select columns in your dataset.

```{r}
newIris <- iris %>% select(Sepal.Width, Species)

head(newIris)
```

## dplyr::mutate()

`mutate()` is one of the most useful dplyr commands. You can use it to transform data and add it as a new column into the data.frame. 

```{r}
#calculate a new variable based on other variables
mutatedData <- rawData %>% 
  mutate(diffWeight = startWeight - endWeight) 

head(mutatedData)

#add a column with the same value for each entry
mutatedData <- mutatedData %>% mutate(site = "Site1") %>% 
  mutate(weightLossPerDay = diffWeight / timeElapsed )

head(mutatedData)
```

## Chaining it all together with pipes

## Reformatting Data

## Reshaping Data

Oftentimes, you will need to change the format of the data.



## Now What?

## Four Basic Principles to Tidyverse

1. Reuse existing data structures
2. Make simple function
3. Embrace functional programming
4. Design for humans

**Source**:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/manifesto.html

## 1. Reuse existing data structures

1. **Reuse existing data structures**
2. Make simple functions
3. Embrace functional programming
4. Design for humans

- Re-use pre-existing data structures
- Many packages (e.g. ggplot2, dplyr) use rectangular data
- Use data frames or tibbles


## 2. Make simple functions

1. Reuse existing data structures
2. **Make simple functions**
3. Embrace functional programming
4. Design for humans

- The pipe character in R is `%>%`
- Functions should be "simple" and do one thing well
- Avoid mixing side-effects
    - Returns object OR
    - Side-effect i.e. changes the input data
- Function names should be verbs


## 3. Embrace functional programming


1. Reuse existing data structures
2. Make simple functions
3. **Embrace functional programming**
4. Design for humans

- R is a functional language
- Immutable objects == objects that don't change
- In other words, if you want to make changes, do a copy-on-modify
- Use tools that abstract out `for` loops e.g. apply methods or mapping


## 4. Design for humans

1. Reuse existing data structures
2. Compose simple functions with the pipe
3. Embrace functional programming
4. **Design for humans**

- Other people will read your code
- Be considerate of others reading your code
- Compute time is secondary to thinking time
- Things to do:
    - Invest time in good names
    - Be explicit and possibly long with names


## Tidyverse Part 1

- `dplyr` (easily tidy data)
- `forcats` (work with categorical variables)
- `ggplot2` (create elegant data visualizations)
- `haven` (import and export SPSS, Stata, and SAS)
- `httr` (work with URLs and HTTP)
- `hms` (pretty time of day)
- `jsonlite` (robust JSON parser)
- `lubridate` (deal with dates easier)

## Tidyverse Part 2

- `purrr` (functional programming)
- `readr` (read tabular data)
- `readxl` (read Excel data)
- `stringr` (manipulate strings)
- `tibble` (simple data frames)
- `rvest` (web scrapping tools)
- `tidyr` (easily tidy data)
- `xml2` (parse XML files)
